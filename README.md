The Crystals
============

The Crystals is a game I am creating using RPG Maker.

Release: July 13, 2014

Description:

It has been 4 years since your father left you in the Tree of Knowledge with only the Crystal of Life to keep you alive. Suddenly, there is a crash, and the Crystal of Death is gone! It has been stolen! Now, the 9 worlds of the Crystal System are in chaos because the energy of the Crystals is unbalanced. You then set off to the worlds to try to find the robber of the Crystal of Death and bring peace back to the Crystal System. Along the way, you will fight monsters and evil spirits, who are constantly trying to stop you from achieving your goal.
